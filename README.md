## Differential Drive Vehicle

This repository is the development for a Differential Drive Vehicle, it will be developed using Arduino for the control of the prototype like DC motors and sensors, and Python to develop neural networks for different applications of the vehicle.

### Arduino

# Controls
There are several controls related to the development of the vehicle so far only two controls are planned, if any other controls or systems are related to the development of the vehicle and requires Arduino will be added to this repository.

## DC motor Speed Control
Speed Control is developed using a tachometer and a L293 integrated as H Bridge
- L293D
Please review the diagram in the Control Section
- Tachometer
Please review the data sheet to understand the connections.
- PID Calculations


## DC motor position Control
Speed Control is developed using a tachometer and a L293 integrated as H Bridge
- L293D
Please review the diagram in the Control Section
- Tachometer
Please review the data sheet to understand the connections.
- PID Calculations

### Python
At the moment we are releasing this section we have no information so far
